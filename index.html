  <p> Welcome! This portfolio serves as a glimpse into my undergraduate academic journey. It includes my successes and struggles, but ultimately, it is an accumulation of the experiences that have shaped me both academically and personally.  </p>
  
  <h2>About</h2>
  <p> I am a senior at the University of Central Florida (UCF) majoring in Biomedical Sciences with specialized study in medical anthropology and the anthropology of   global health. I am passionate about health equity, access to healthcare, public health, Haiti, and the global south. I am interested in pursuing a combined Ph.D. in medical anthropology and an MPH. Through my graduate studies I hope to contribute to the knowledge of health experience and illness, and apply my research in health interventions for improved health and quality of life.</p>
